#printing a letter from a string

#we can use underscores to express large numbers
#python interprets it as a normal number 
#whereas it makes it easier to read for us

#F strings

#to print different data types in the previous output
# we convert a lot of datatypes and shit
#to simplify it we use f string
#when we use this
#python automatically detects the datatype
#changes it accordingly for the print statement to work
